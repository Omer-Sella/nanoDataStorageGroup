# Setting up, howto, and a cookbook for new students and staff at our research group https://dnastorage.doc.ic.ac.uk/

1. Getting started with Department of Computing (DoC) GPU machines
DoC has some GPU machines that can be accessed using
```console
ssh  <username>@gpu<NUMBER>.doc.ic.ac.uk
```
Where username is your @ic.ac.uk username, and NUMBER is one of 11-35 numbers.
This assumes you are either connected to a college managed machine, or are within college network. Otherwise you may have to first 
```console
ssh <username>@shell1.doc.ic.uk
```
and only then ssh to a GPU machine. The ull guide is here: https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/people/csg/guides/remote-access/ssh/
